Prepare the SQL database
Allow Azure services to access the logical SQL Server of your Azure SQL Database.
Verify that the setting Allow Azure services and resources to access this server is enabled for your server that's running SQL Database. 
This setting lets Data Factory write data to your database instance. 
To verify and turn on this setting, go to logical SQL server > Security > Firewalls and virtual networks > 
set the Allow Azure services and resources to access this server option to ON.
